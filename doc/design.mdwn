## Modular Design

The current system is far too tied together and monolithic.  Here's a
key question: how would multiple users of a single system each operate
their own Bitcoin wallet without sharing a wallet?  I don't see how at
present.  However, I don't think it's a fundamental limitation; the
problem is simply that the programs aren't split in the right places.
To be a Bitcoin node means that you are willing to track the public
block chain, and possible to generate your own blocks.  There is
absolutely no requirement to keep a local wallet, or have and knowledge
of private keys.  The more nodes in the Bitcoin network, the better.

If I want to create a transaction, I don't need any knowledge of the
live block chain, since I will not be deciding which block the
transaction goes in.  Only the generating nodes can do that.

If I am correct, a wallet-only node needs only support the
`inv`-`getdata`-`tx` sequence to enable spending, and
`inv`-`getdata`-`block` for confirming receipt.
