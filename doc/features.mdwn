What makes Bitcoin good?


### Transaction fees set by free market

Transaction fees determined by unfettered competition, not by virtue of
monopoly position.  Banks are allowed to act as banks because they have
been given a license to do so by governments.  That makes them a
government mandated monopoly, and therefore you have to pay whatever
figure they make up for whatever purpose they make it up.  You may at
this point shout "but my banking is free".  No, it's not, either by
lower interest rates, higher fees (and hence higher prices) from your
suppliers or by longer transaction times (ask yourself why it takes four
days to move money from electronic account to electronic account in an
era when you can video chat with someone in the Antarctic).

Bitcoin solves that problem by having no barriers to entry for miners,
who act as the engine room of Bitcoin transactions; with each competing
with other to earn the fees offered by participants.


### Transaction security

The electronic economy of banks runs primarily by building an
impregnable wall between their (your) data, and the attackers.  Banks
keep the secrets on their computers.

Bitcoin on the other hand keeps all the transaction data in public,
broadcast to every node to anyone who wants to listen.  The secrets are
kept in your hands, on your computer.

Your privacy is maintained not by virtue of not revealing the
information, but by virtue of the fact that the only person to whom the
publicly released information has meaning is to you.

### No chargebacks

Trust is a problem.  In the world where control of your money has been
delegated to a third party you have to trust that they one day won't
undo a transaction you make.

You must trust the person who sends you money, because there are a large
number of ways that transactions can be undone.  If your customer
chooses to ring their credit card supplier and say "I want my money
back", they will take back the money you thought was yours.

Bitcoin is digital cash.  Cash cannot be taken back, all sales are
final.  This might sound like a bad thing if you are used to living in a
nanny-run world where personal responsibility is not considered
necessary; but it isn't.  It will force you to be sure that you are
paying the right person for the right thing.

That being said: most retailers don't force you to go to the clearing
house to undo a transaction.  If they have any sense, they get
themselves a good reputation with customers by treating them fairly and
operating a good returns policy.  That wouldn't change in a Bitcoin
economy.

### Freedom

Being able to send any amount of money to anywhere in the world is
liberating.  Until you've used Bitcoin for real, you won't understand
how truly extraordinary it is.  No bank log in, no tracking, no
money-laundering protections, no borders, and no foreign exchanges.

Let's say you're going on holiday.  In a Bitcoin world, you'll just load
up your mobile wallet and off you go.  Even before Bitcoin takes over,
you can use Bitcoin as an intermediate currency to beam your Euros to
Australia and have them converted instantly.
